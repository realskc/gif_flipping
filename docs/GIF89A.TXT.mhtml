    Cover Sheet for the GIF89a Specification


    DEFERRED CLEAR CODE IN LZW COMPRESSION

    There has been confusion about where clear codes can be found in the
    data stream.  As the specification says, they may appear at anytime.  T=
here
    is not a requirement to send a clear code when the string table is full=
.

    It is the encoder's decision as to when the table should be cleared.  W=
hen
    the table is full, the encoder can chose to use the table as is, making=
 no
    changes to it until the encoder chooses to clear it.  The encoder durin=
g
    this time sends out codes that are of the maximum Code Size.

    As we can see from the above, when the decoder's table is full, it must
    not change the table until a clear code is received.  The Code Size is =
that
    of the maximum Code Size.  Processing other than this is done normally.

    Because of a large base of decoders that do not handle the decompressio=
n in
    this manner, we ask developers of GIF encoding software to NOT implemen=
t
    this feature until at least January 1991 and later if they see that the=
ir
    particular market is not ready for it.  This will give developers of GI=
F
    decoding software time to implement this feature and to get it into the
    hands of their clients before the decoders start "breaking" on the new
    GIF's.  It is not required that encoders change their software to take
    advantage of the deferred clear code, but it is for decoders.

    APPLICATION EXTENSION BLOCK - APPLICATION IDENTIFIER

    There will be a Courtesy Directory file located on CompuServe in the PI=
CS
    forum.  This directory will contain Application Identifiers for Applica=
tion
    Extension Blocks that have been used by developers of GIF applications.
    This file is intended to help keep developers that wish to create
    Application Extension Blocks from using the same Application Identifier=
s.
    This is not an official directory; it is for voluntary participation on=
ly
    and does not guarantee that someone will not use the same identifier.

    E-Mail can be sent to Larry Wood (forum manager of PICS) indicating the
    request for inclusion in this file with an identifier.

4. About the Document.

This document describes in detail the definition of the Graphics Interchang=
e
Format.  This document is intended as a programming reference; it is
recommended that the entire document be read carefully before programming,
because of the interdependence of the various parts. There is an individual
section for each of the Format blocks. Within each section, the sub-section
labeled Required Version refers to the version number that an encoder will =
have
to use if the corresponding block is used in the Data Stream. Within each
section, a diagram describes the individual fields in the block; the diagra=
ms
are drawn vertically; top bytes in the diagram appear first in the Data Str=
eam.
Bits within a byte are drawn most significant on the left end.  Multi-byte
numeric fields are ordered Least Significant Byte first. Numeric constants =
are
represented as Hexadecimal numbers, preceded by "0x".  Bit fields within a =
byte
are described in order from most significant bits to least significant bits=
.


5. General Description.

The Graphics Interchange Format(sm) defines a protocol intended for the on-=
line
transmission and interchange of raster graphic data in a way that is
independent of the hardware used in their creation or display.

The Graphics Interchange Format is defined in terms of blocks and sub-block=
s
which contain relevant parameters and data used in the reproduction of a
graphic. A GIF Data Stream is a sequence of protocol blocks and sub-blocks
representing a collection of graphics. In general, the graphics in a Data
Stream are assumed to be related to some degree, and to share some control
information; it is recommended that encoders attempt to group together rela=
ted
graphics in order to minimize hardware changes during processing and to
minimize control information overhead. For the same reason, unrelated graph=
ics
or graphics which require resetting hardware parameters should be encoded
separately to the extent possible.

A Data Stream may originate locally, as when read from a file, or it may
originate remotely, as when transmitted over a data communications line. Th=
e
Format is defined with the assumption that an error-free Transport Level
Protocol is used for communications; the Format makes no provisions for
error-detection and error-correction.

The GIF Data Stream must be interpreted in context, that is, the applicatio=
n
program must rely on information external to the Data Stream to invoke the
decoder process.


6. Version Numbers.

The version number in the Header of a Data Stream is intended to identify t=
he
minimum set of capabilities required of a decoder in order to fully process=
 the
Data Stream.  An encoder should use the earliest possible version number th=
at
includes all the blocks used in the Data Stream. Within each block section =
in
this document, there is an entry labeled Required Version which specifies t=
he







                                                                         3


earliest version number that includes the corresponding block.  The encoder
should make every attempt to use the earliest version number covering all t=
he
blocks in the Data Stream; the unnecessary use of later version numbers wil=
l
hinder processing by some decoders.


7. The Encoder.

The Encoder is the program used to create a GIF Data Stream. From raster da=
ta
and other information, the encoder produces the necessary control and data
blocks needed for reproducing the original graphics.

The encoder has the following primary responsibilities.

            - Include in the Data Stream all the necessary information to
            reproduce  the graphics.

            - Insure that a Data Stream is labeled with the earliest possib=
le
            Version Number that will cover the definition of all the blocks=
 in
            it; this is to ensure that the largest number of decoders can
            process the Data Stream.

            - Ensure encoding of the graphics in such a way that the decodi=
ng
            process is optimized. Avoid redundant information as much as
            possible.

            - To the extent possible, avoid grouping graphics which might
            require resetting hardware parameters during the decoding proce=
ss.

            - Set to zero (off) each of the bits of each and every field
            designated as reserved. Note that some fields in the Logical Sc=
reen
            Descriptor and the Image Descriptor were reserved under Version
            87a, but are used under version 89a.


8. The Decoder.

The Decoder is the program used to process a GIF Data Stream. It processes =
the
Data Stream sequentially, parsing the various blocks and sub-blocks, using =
the
control information to set hardware and process parameters and interpreting=
 the
data to render the graphics.

The decoder has the following primary responsibilities.

            - Process each graphic in the Data Stream in sequence, without
            delays other than those specified in the control information.

            - Set its hardware parameters to fit, as closely as possible, t=
he
            control information contained in the Data Stream.


9. Compliance.

An encoder or a decoder is said to comply with a given version of the Graph=
ics
Interchange Format if and only if it fully conforms with and correctly
implements the definition of the standard associated with that version.  An







                                                                         4


encoder or a decoder may be compliant with a given version number and not
compliant with some subsequent version.


10. About Recommendations.

Each block section in this document contains an entry labeled Recommendatio=
n;
this section lists a set of recommendations intended to guide and organize =
the
use of the particular blocks. Such recommendations are geared towards makin=
g
the functions of encoders and decoders more efficient, as well as making
optimal use of the communications bandwidth.  It is advised that these
recommendations be followed.


11. About Color Tables.

The GIF format utilizes color tables to render raster-based graphics. A col=
or
table can have one of two different scopes: global or local. A Global Color
Table is used by all those graphics in the Data Stream which do not have a
Local Color Table associated with them. The scope of the Global Color Table=
 is
the entire Data Stream. A Local Color Table is always associated with the
graphic that immediately follows it; the scope of a Local Color Table is
limited to that single graphic. A Local Color Table supersedes a Global Col=
or
Table, that is, if a Data Stream contains a Global Color Table, and an imag=
e
has a Local Color Table associated with it, the decoder must save the Globa=
l
Color Table, use the Local Color Table to render the image, and then restor=
e
the Global Color Table. Both types of color tables are optional, making it
possible for a Data Stream to contain numerous graphics without a color tab=
le
at all. For this reason, it is recommended that the decoder save the last
Global Color Table used until another Global Color Table is encountered. In
this way, a Data Stream which does not contain either a Global Color Table =
or
a Local Color Table may be processed using the last Global Color Table save=
d.
If a Global Color Table from a previous Stream is used, that table becomes =
the
Global Color Table of the present Stream. This is intended to reduce the
overhead incurred by color tables. In particular, it is recommended that an
encoder use only one Global Color Table if all the images in related Data
Streams can be rendered with the same table.  If no color table is availabl=
e at
all, the decoder is free to use a system color table or a table of its own.=
 In
that case, the decoder may use a color table with as many colors as its
hardware is able to support; it is recommended that such a table have black=
 and
white as its first two entries, so that monochrome images can be rendered
adequately.

The Definition of the GIF Format allows for a Data Stream to contain only t=
he
Header, the Logical Screen Descriptor, a Global Color Table and the GIF
Trailer. Such a Data Stream would be used to load a decoder with a Global C=
olor
Table, in preparation for subsequent Data Streams without a color table at =
all.


12. Blocks, Extensions and Scope.

Blocks can be classified into three groups : Control, Graphic-Rendering and
Special Purpose.  Control blocks, such as the Header, the Logical Screen
Descriptor, the Graphic Control Extension and the Trailer, contain informat=
ion
used to control the process of the Data Stream or information  used in sett=
ing
hardware parameters.  Graphic-Rendering blocks such as the Image Descriptor=
 and







                                                                         5


the Plain Text Extension contain information and data used to render a grap=
hic
on the display device. Special Purpose blocks such as the Comment Extension=
 and
the Application Extension are neither used to control the process of the Da=
ta
Stream nor do they contain information or data used to render a graphic on =
the
display device. With the exception of the Logical Screen Descriptor and the
Global Color Table, whose scope is the entire Data Stream, all other Contro=
l
blocks have a limited scope, restricted to the Graphic-Rendering block that
follows them.  Special Purpose blocks do not delimit the scope of any Contr=
ol
blocks; Special Purpose blocks are transparent to the decoding process.
Graphic-Rendering blocks and extensions are used as scope delimiters for
Control blocks and extensions. The labels used to identify labeled blocks f=
all
into three ranges : 0x00-0x7F (0-127) are the Graphic Rendering blocks,
excluding the Trailer (0x3B); 0x80-0xF9 (128-249) are the Control blocks;
0xFA-0xFF (250-255) are the Special Purpose blocks. These ranges are define=
d so
that decoders can handle block scope by appropriately identifying block lab=
els,
even when the block itself cannot be processed.


13. Block Sizes.

The Block Size field in a block, counts the number of bytes remaining in th=
e
block, not counting the Block Size field itself, and not counting the Block
Terminator, if one is to follow.  Blocks other than Data Blocks are intende=
d to
be of fixed length; the Block Size field is provided in order to facilitate
skipping them, not to allow their size to change in the future.  Data block=
s
and sub-blocks are of variable length to accommodate the amount of data.


14. Using GIF as an embedded protocol.

As an embedded protocol, GIF may be part of larger application protocols,
within which GIF is used to render graphics.  In such a case, the applicati=
on
protocol could define a block within which the GIF Data Stream would be
contained. The application program would then invoke a GIF decoder upon
encountering a block of type GIF.  This approach is recommended in favor of
using Application Extensions, which become overhead for all other applicati=
ons
that do not process them. Because a GIF Data Stream must be processed in
context, the application must rely on some means of identifying the GIF Dat=
a
Stream outside of the Stream itself.


15. Data Sub-blocks.

      a. Description. Data Sub-blocks are units containing data. They do no=
t
      have a label, these blocks are processed in the context of control
      blocks, wherever data blocks are specified in the format. The first b=
yte
      of the Data sub-block indicates the number of data bytes to follow. A
      data sub-block may contain from 0 to 255 data bytes. The size of the
      block does not account for the size byte itself, therefore, the empty
      sub-block is one whose size field contains 0x00.

            i) Signature - Identifies the GIF Data Stream. This field conta=
ins
            the fixed value 'GIF'.

            ii) Version - Version number used to format the data stream.
            Identifies the minimum set of capabilities necessary to a decod=
er
            to fully process the contents of the Data Stream.

            Version Numbers as of 10 July 1990 :       "87a" - May 1987
                                                       "89a" - July 1989

            Version numbers are ordered numerically increasing on the first=
 two
            digits starting with 87 (87,88,...,99,00,...,85,86) and
            alphabetically increasing on the third character (a,...,z).

            iii) Extensions and Scope. The scope of this block is the entir=

            Data Stream. This block cannot be modified by any extension.










                                                                         8


      d. Recommendations.

            i) Signature - This field identifies the beginning of the GIF D=
ata
            Stream; it is not intended to provide a unique signature for th=
e
            identification of the data. It is recommended that the GIF Data
            Stream be identified externally by the application. (Refer to
            Appendix G for on-line identification of the GIF Data Stream.)

            ii) Version - ENCODER : An encoder should use the earliest poss=
ible
            version number that defines all the blocks used in the Data Str=
eam.
            When two or more Data Streams are combined, the latest of the
            individual version numbers should be used for the resulting Dat=
a
            Stream. DECODER : A decoder should attempt to process the data
            stream to the best of its ability; if it encounters a version
            number which it is not capable of processing fully, it should
            nevertheless, attempt to process the data stream to the best of=
 its
            ability, perhaps after warning the user that the data may be
            incomplete.


18. Logical Screen Descriptor.

      a. Description.  The Logical Screen Descriptor contains the parameter=
s
      necessary to define the area of the display device within which the
      images will be rendered.  The coordinates in this block are given wit=
h
      respect to the top-left corner of the virtual screen; they do not
      necessarily refer to absolute coordinates on the display device.  Thi=
s
      implies that they could refer to window coordinates in a window-based
      environment or printer coordinates when a printer is used.

      This block is REQUIRED; exactly one Logical Screen Descriptor must be
      present per Data Stream.

      b. Required Version.  Not applicable. This block is not subject to a
      version number. This block must appear immediately after the Header.

                             Size of Global Color Table    3 Bits

            i) Logical Screen Width - Width, in pixels, of the Logical Scre=
en
            where the images will be rendered in the displaying device.

            ii) Logical Screen Height - Height, in pixels, of the Logical
            Screen where the images will be rendered in the displaying devi=
ce.

            iii) Global Color Table Flag - Flag indicating the presence of =
a
            Global Color Table; if the flag is set, the Global Color Table =
will
            immediately follow the Logical Screen Descriptor. This flag als=
o
            selects the interpretation of the Background Color Index; if th=
e
            flag is set, the value of the Background Color Index field shou=
ld
            be used as the table index of the background color. (This field=
 is
            the most significant bit of the byte.)

            Values :    0 -   No Global Color Table follows, the Background
                              Color Index field is meaningless.
                        1 -   A Global Color Table will immediately follow,=
 the
                              Background Color Index field is meaningful.

            iv) Color Resolution - Number of bits per primary color availab=
le
            to the original image, minus 1. This value represents the size =
of
            the entire palette from which the colors in the graphic were
            selected, not the number of colors actually used in the graphic=
.
            For example, if the value in this field is 3, then the palette =
of
            the original image had 4 bits per primary color available to cr=
eate
            the image.  This value should be set to indicate the richness o=
f
            the original palette, even if not every color from the whole
            palette is available on the source machine.

            v) Sort Flag - Indicates whether the Global Color Table is sort=
ed.
            If the flag is set, the Global Color Table is sorted, in order =
of
            decreasing importance. Typically, the order would be decreasing
            frequency, with most frequent color first. This assists a decod=
er,
            with fewer available colors, in choosing the best subset of col=
ors;
            the decoder may use an initial segment of the table to render t=
he
            graphic.

            Values :    0 -   Not ordered.
                        1 -   Ordered by decreasing importance, most
                              important color first.

            vi) Size of Global Color Table - If the Global Color Table Flag=
 is
            set to 1, the value in this field is used to calculate the numb=
er
            of bytes contained in the Global Color Table. To determine that
            actual size of the color table, raise 2 to [the value of the fi=
eld
            + 1].  Even if there is no Global Color Table specified, set th=
is
            field according to the above formula so that decoders can choos=
e
            the best graphics mode to display the stream in.  (This field i=
s
            made up of the 3 least significant bits of the byte.)

            vii) Background Color Index - Index into the Global Color Table=
 for







                                                                        10


            the Background Color. The Background Color is the color used fo=
r
            those pixels on the screen that are not covered by an image. If=
 the
            Global Color Table Flag is set to (zero), this field should be =
zero
            and should be ignored.

            viii) Pixel Aspect Ratio - Factor used to compute an approximat=
ion
            of the aspect ratio of the pixel in the original image.  If the
            value of the field is not 0, this approximation of the aspect r=
atio
            is computed based on the formula:

            Aspect Ratio =3D (Pixel Aspect Ratio + 15) / 64

            The Pixel Aspect Ratio is defined to be the quotient of the pix=
el's
            width over its height.  The value range in this field allows
            specification of the widest pixel of 4:1 to the tallest pixel o=
f
            1:4 in increments of 1/64th.

            Values :        0 -   No aspect ratio information is given.
                       1..255 -   Value used in the computation.

      d. Extensions and Scope. The scope of this block is the entire Data
      Stream. This block cannot be modified by any extension.

      e. Recommendations. None.


19. Global Color Table.

      a. Description. This block contains a color table, which is a sequenc=
e of
      bytes representing red-green-blue color triplets. The Global Color Ta=
ble
      is used by images without a Local Color Table and by Plain Text
      Extensions. Its presence is marked by the Global Color Table Flag bei=
ng
      set to 1 in the Logical Screen Descriptor; if present, it immediately
      follows the Logical Screen Descriptor and contains a number of bytes
      equal to
                    3 x 2^(Size of Global Color Table+1).

      This block is OPTIONAL; at most one Global Color Table may be present
      per Data Stream.

20. Image Descriptor.

      a. Description. Each image in the Data Stream is composed of an Image
      Descriptor, an optional Local Color Table, and the image data.  Each
      image must fit within the boundaries of the Logical Screen, as define=
d
      in the Logical Screen Descriptor.

      The Image Descriptor contains the parameters necessary to process a t=
able
      based image. The coordinates given in this block refer to coordinates
      within the Logical Screen, and are given in pixels. This block is a
      Graphic-Rendering Block, optionally preceded by one or more Control
      blocks such as the Graphic Control Extension, and may be optionally
      followed by a Local Color Table; the Image Descriptor is always follo=
wed
      by the image data.

      This block is REQUIRED for an image.  Exactly one Image Descriptor mu=
st
      be present per image in the Data Stream.  An unlimited number of imag=
es
      may be present per Data Stream.

           i) Image Separator - Identifies the beginning of an Image
           Descriptor. This field contains the fixed value 0x2C.

           ii) Image Left Position - Column number, in pixels, of the left =
edge
           of the image, with respect to the left edge of the Logical Scree=
n.
           Leftmost column of the Logical Screen is 0.

 of
           the image with respect to the top edge of the Logical Screen. To=
p
           row of the Logical Screen is 0.

           iv) Image Width - Width of the image in pixels.

           v) Image Height - Height of the image in pixels.

           vi) Local Color Table Flag - Indicates the presence of a Local C=

           vii) Interlace Flag - Indicates if the image is interlaced. An i=
mage
           is interlaced in a four-pass interlace pattern; see Appendix E f=
or
           details.

           Values :    0 - Image is not interlaced.
                       1 - Image is interlaced.

                              important color first.

            ix) Size of Local Color Table - If the Local Color Table Flag i=
s
            set to 1, the value in this field is used to calculate the numb=
er
            of bytes contained in the Local Color Table. To determine that
            actual size of the color table, raise 2 to the value of the fie=
ld
            + 1. This value should be 0 if there is no Local Color Table
            specified. (This field is made up of the 3 least significant bi=

     is used by the image that immediately follows. Its presence is marked =
by
     the Local Color Table Flag being set to 1 in the Image Descriptor; if
     present, the Local Color Table immediately follows the Image Descripto=
r
     and contains a number of bytes equal to
                          3x2^(Size of Local Color Table+1).
     If present, this color table temporarily becomes the active color tabl=
e
     and the following image should be processed using it. This block is
     OPTIONAL; at most one Local Color Table may be present per Image
     Descriptor and its scope is the single image associated with the Image
     Descriptor that precedes it.

22. Table Based Image Data.

     a. Description. The image data for a table based image consists of a
     sequence of sub-blocks, of size at most 255 bytes each, containing an
     index into the active color table, for each pixel in the image.  Pixel
     indices are in order of left to right and from top to bottom.  Each in=
dex
     must be within the range of the size of the active color table, starti=
ng
     at 0. The sequence of indices is encoded using the LZW Algorithm with
     variable-length code, as described in Appendix F

            block. This field contains the fixed value 0x21.

            ii) Graphic Control Label - Identifies the current block as a
            Graphic Control Extension. This field contains the fixed value
            0xF9.

            iii) Block Size - Number of bytes in the block, after the Block
            Size field and up to but not including the Block Terminator.  T=
his
            field contains the fixed value 4.

            iv) Disposal Method - Indicates the way in which the graphic is=
 to
            be treated after being displayed.

            Values :    0 -   No disposal specified. The decoder is
                              not required to take any action.
                        1 -   Do not dispose. The graphic is to be left
                              in place.
                        2 -   Restore to background color. The area used by=
 the
                              graphic must be restored to the background co=
lor.
                        3 -   Restore to previous. The decoder is required =
to
                              restore the area overwritten by the graphic w=
ith
                              what was there prior to rendering the graphic=
.
                     4-7 -    To be defined.

            v) User Input Flag - Indicates whether or not user input is
            expected before continuing. If the flag is set, processing will
            continue when user input is entered. The nature of the User inp=
ut
            is determined by the application (Carriage Return, Mouse Button
            Click, etc.).

            Values :    0 -   User input is not expected.
                        1 -   User input is expected.

            When a Delay Time is used and the User Input Flag is set,
            processing will continue when user input is received or when th=
e
            delay time expires, whichever occurs first.

            vi) Transparency Flag - Indicates whether a transparency index =
is
            given in the Transparent Index field. (This field is the least
            significant bit of the byte.)

            Values :    0 -   Transparent Index is not given.
                        1 -   Transparent Index is given.

            vii) Delay Time - If not 0, this field specifies the number of
            hundredths (1/100) of a second to wait before continuing with t=
he
            processing of the Data Stream. The clock starts ticking immedia=
tely
            after the graphic is rendered. This field may be used in
            conjunction with the User Input Flag field.

            viii) Transparency Index - The Transparency Index is such that =
when
            encountered, the corresponding pixel of the display device is n=
ot
            modified and processing goes on to the next pixel. The index is
            present if and only if the Transparency Flag is set to 1.

            ix) Block Terminator - This zero-length data block marks the en=

                                                                        17

            the Graphic Control Extension.

      d. Extensions and Scope. The scope of this Extension is the graphic
      rendering block that follows it; it is possible for other extensions =
to
      be present between this block and its target. This block can modify t=
he
      Image Descriptor Block and the Plain Text Extension.

      e. Recommendations.

            i) Disposal Method - The mode Restore To Previous is intended t=
o be
            used in small sections of the graphic; the use of this mode imp=
oses
            severe demands on the decoder to store the section of the graph=
ic
            that needs to be saved. For this reason, this mode should be us=
ed
            sparingly.  This mode is not intended to save an entire graphic=
 or
            large areas of a graphic; when this is the case, the encoder sh=
ould
            make every attempt to make the sections of the graphic to be
            restored be separate graphics in the data stream. In the case w=
here
            a decoder is not capable of saving an area of a graphic marked =
as
            Restore To Previous, it is recommended that a decoder restore t=
o
            the background color.

            ii) User Input Flag - When the flag is set, indicating that use=
r
            input is expected, the decoder may sound the bell (0x07) to ale=
rt
            the user that input is being expected.  In the absence of a
            specified Delay Time, the decoder should wait for user input
            indefinitely.  It is recommended that the encoder not set the U=
ser
            Input Flag without a Delay Time specified.


24. Comment Extension.

      a. Description. The Comment Extension contains textual information wh=
ich
      is not part of the actual graphics in the GIF Data Stream. It is suit=
able
      for including comments about the graphics, credits, descriptions or a=
ny
      other type of non-control and non-graphic data.  The Comment Extensio=
n
      may be ignored by the decoder, or it may be saved for later processin=
g;
      under no circumstances should a Comment Extension disrupt or interfer=
e
      with the processing of the Data Stream.

      This block is OPTIONAL; any number of them may appear in the Data Str=
eam.

      d. Extensions and Scope. This block does not have scope. This block
      cannot be modified by any extension.

      e. Recommendations.

            i) Data - This block is intended for humans.  It should contain
            text using the 7-bit ASCII character set. This block should
            not be used to store control information for custom processing.

            ii) Position - This block may appear at any point in the Data
            Stream at which a block can begin; however, it is recommended t=
hat
            Comment Extensions do not interfere with Control or Data blocks=
;
            they should be located at the beginning or at the end of the Da=
ta
            Stream to the extent possible.


25. Plain Text Extension.

      a. Description. The Plain Text Extension contains textual data and th=
e
      parameters necessary to render that data as a graphic, in a simple fo=
rm.
      The textual data will be encoded with the 7-bit printable ASCII
      characters.  Text data are rendered using a grid of character cells








                                                                        19


      defined by the parameters in the block fields. Each character is rend=
ered
      in an individual cell. The textual data in this block is to be render=
ed
      as mono-spaced characters, one character per cell, with a best fittin=
g
      font and size. For further information, see the section on
      Recommendations below. The data characters are taken sequentially fro=
m
      the data portion of the block and rendered within a cell, starting wi=
th
      the upper left cell in the grid and proceeding from left to right and
      from top to bottom. Text data is rendered until the end of data is
      reached or the character grid is filled.  The Character Grid contains=
 an
      integral number of cells; in the case that the cell dimensions do not
      allow for an integral number, fractional cells must be discarded; an
      encoder must be careful to specify the grid dimensions accurately so =
that
      this does not happen. This block requires a Global Color Table to be
      available; the colors used by this block reference the Global Color T=
able
      in the Stream if there is one, or the Global Color Table from a previ=
ous
      Stream, if one was saved. This block is a graphic rendering block,
      therefore it may be modified by a Graphic Control Extension.  This bl=
ock
      is OPTIONAL; any number of them may appear in the Data Stream.

            edge of the text grid, with respect to the left edge of the Log=
ical
            Screen.

            v) Text Grid Top Position - Row number, in pixels, of the top e=
dge
            of the text grid, with respect to the top edge of the Logical
            Screen.

            vi) Image Grid Width - Width of the text grid in pixels.

            vii) Image Grid Height - Height of the text grid in pixels.

            viii) Character Cell Width - Width, in pixels, of each cell in =
the
            grid.

            ix) Character Cell Height - Height, in pixels, of each cell in =
the
            grid.

            x) Text Foreground Color Index - Index into the Global Color Ta=
ble
            to be used to render the text foreground.

            xi) Text Background Color Index - Index into the Global Color T=
able
            to be used to render the text background.

            xii) Plain Text Data - Sequence of sub-blocks, each of size at =
most
            255 bytes and at least 1 byte, with the size in a byte precedin=
g
            the data.  The end of the sequence is marked by the Block
            Terminator.

            xiii) Block Terminator - This zero-length data block marks the =
end
            of the Plain Text Data Blocks.

      d. Extensions and Scope. The scope of this block is the Plain Text Da=
ta
      Block contained in it. This block may be modified by the Graphic Cont=
rol
      Extension.

      e. Recommendations. The data in the Plain Text Extension is assumed t=
o be
      preformatted. The selection of font and size is left to the discretio=
n of
      the decoder.  If characters less than 0x20 or greater than 0xf7 are
      encountered, it is recommended that the decoder display a Space chara=
cter
      (0x20). The encoder should use grid and cell dimensions such that an
      integral number of cells fit in the grid both horizontally as well as
      vertically.  For broadest compatibility, character cell dimensions sh=
ould
      be around 8x8 or 8x16 (width x height); consider an image for unusual
      sized text.

Appendix
B. GIF Grammar.

A Grammar is a form of notation to represent the sequence in which certain
objects form larger objects.  A grammar is also used to represent the numbe=
r of
objects that can occur at a given position.  The grammar given here represe=
nts
the sequence of blocks that form the GIF Data Stream. A grammar is given by
listing its rules.  Each rule consists of the left-hand side, followed by s=
ome
form of equals sign, followed by the right-hand side.  In a rule, the
right-hand side describes how the left-hand side is defined. The right-hand
side consists of a sequence of entities, with the possible presence of spec=
ial
symbols. The following legend defines the symbols used in this grammar for =
GIF.

Legend:           &lt;&gt;    grammar word
                  ::=3D   defines symbol
                  *     zero or more occurrences
                  +     one or more occurrences
                  |     alternate element
                  []    optional element

Example:

&lt;GIF Data Stream&gt; ::=3D Header &lt;Logical Screen&gt; &lt;Data&gt;* T=
railer

This rule defines the entity &lt;GIF Data Stream&gt; as follows. It must be=
gin with a
Header. The Header is followed by an entity called Logical Screen, which is
defined below by another rule. The Logical Screen is followed by the entity
Data, which is also defined below by another rule. Finally, the entity Data=
 is
followed by the Trailer.  Since there is no rule defining the Header or the
Trailer, this means that these blocks are defined in the document.  The ent=
ity
Data has a special symbol (*) following it which means that, at this positi=
on,
the entity Data may be repeated any number of times, including 0 times. For
further reading on this subject, refer to a standard text on Programming
Languages.

NOTE : The grammar indicates that it is possible for a GIF Data Stream to
contain the Header, the Logical Screen Descriptor, a Global Color Table and=
 the
GIF Trailer. This special case is used to load a GIF decoder with a Global
Color Table, in preparation for subsequent Data Streams without color table=
s at
all.


























































                                                                        27


Appendix
C. Glossary.

Active Color Table - Color table used to render the next graphic. If the ne=
xt
graphic is an image which has a Local Color Table associated with it, the
active color table becomes the Local Color Table associated with that image=
.
If the next graphic is an image without a Local Color Table, or a Plain Tex=
t
Extension, the active color table is the Global Color Table associated with=
 the
Data Stream, if there is one; if there is no Global Color Table in the Data
Stream, the active color table is a color table saved from a previous Data
Stream, or one supplied by the decoder.

Block - Collection of bytes forming a protocol unit. In general, the term
includes labeled and unlabeled blocks, as well as Extensions.

Data Stream - The GIF Data Stream is composed of blocks and sub-blocks
representing images and graphics, together with control information to rend=
er
them on a display device. All control and data blocks in the Data Stream mu=
st
follow the Header and must precede the Trailer.

Decoder - A program capable of processing a GIF Data Stream to render the
images and graphics contained in it.

Encoder - A program capable of capturing and formatting image and graphic
raster data, following the definitions of the Graphics Interchange Format.

Extension - A protocol block labeled by the Extension Introducer 0x21.

Extension Introducer - Label (0x21) defining an Extension.

Graphic - Data which can be rendered on the screen by virtue of some algori=
thm.
The term graphic is more general than the term image; in addition to images=
,
the term graphic also includes data such as text, which is rendered using
character bit-maps.

Image - Data representing a picture or a drawing; an image is represented b=
y an
array of pixels called the raster of the image.

Raster - Array of pixel values representing an image.
























                                                                        28


Appendix
D. Conventions.

Animation - The Graphics Interchange Format is not intended as a platform f=
or
animation, even though it can be done in a limited way.

Byte Ordering - Unless otherwise stated, multi-byte numeric fields are orde=
red
with the Least Significant Byte first.

Color Indices - Color indices always refer to the active color table, eithe=
r
the Global Color Table or the Local Color Table.

Color Order - Unless otherwise stated, all triple-component RGB color value=
s
are specified in Red-Green-Blue order.

Color Tables - Both color tables, the Global and the Local, are optional; i=
f
present, the Global Color Table is to be used with every image in the Data
Stream for which a Local Color Table is not given; if present, a Local Colo=
r
Table overrides the Global Color Table.  However, if neither color table is
present, the application program is free to use an arbitrary color table. I=
f
the graphics in several Data Streams are related and all use the same color
table, an encoder could place the color table as the Global Color Table in =
the
first Data Stream and leave subsequent Data Streams without a Global Color
Table or any Local Color Tables; in this way, the overhead for the table is
eliminated.  It is recommended that the decoder save the previous Global Co=
lor
Table to be used with the Data Stream that follows, in case it does not con=
tain
either a Global Color Table or any Local Color Tables. In general, this all=
ows
the application program to use past color tables, significantly reducing
transmission overhead.

Extension Blocks - Extensions are defined using the Extension Introducer co=
de
to mark the beginning of the block, followed by a block label, identifying =
the
type of extension.  Extension Codes are numbers in the range from 0x00 to 0=
xFF,
inclusive. Special purpose extensions are transparent to the decoder and ma=
y be
omitted when transmitting the Data Stream on-line. The GIF capabilities
dialogue makes the provision for the receiver to request the transmission o=
f
all blocks; the default state in this regard is no transmission of Special
purpose blocks.

Reserved Fields - All Reserved Fields are expected to have each bit set to =
zero
(off).






















                                                                        29


Appendix
E. Interlaced Images.

The rows of an Interlaced images are arranged in the following order:

      Group 1 : Every 8th. row, starting with row 0.              (Pass 1)
      Group 2 : Every 8th. row, starting with row 4.              (Pass 2)
      Group 3 : Every 4th. row, starting with row 2.              (Pass 3)
      Group 4 : Every 2nd. row, starting with row 1.              (Pass 4)

The Following example illustrates how the rows of an interlaced image are
ordered.

Appendix
F. Variable-Length-Code LZW Compression.

The Variable-Length-Code LZW Compression is a variation of the Lempel-Ziv
Compression algorithm in which variable-length codes are used to replace
patterns detected in the original data. The algorithm uses a code or
translation table constructed from the patterns encountered in the original
data; each new pattern is entered into the table and its index is used to
replace it in the compressed stream.

The compressor takes the data from the input stream and builds a code or
translation table with the patterns as it encounters them; each new pattern=
 is
entered into the code table and its index is added to the output stream; wh=
en a
pattern is encountered which had been detected since the last code table
refresh, its index from the code table is put on the output stream, thus
achieving the data compression.  The expander takes input from the compress=
ed
data stream and builds the code or translation table from it; as the compre=
ssed
data stream is processed, codes are used to index into the code table and t=
he
corresponding data is put on the decompressed output stream, thus achieving
data decompression.  The details of the algorithm are explained below.  The
Variable-Length-Code aspect of the algorithm is based on an initial code si=
ze
(LZW-initial code size), which specifies the initial number of bits used fo=
r
the compression codes.  When the number of patterns detected by the compres=
sor
in the input stream exceeds the number of patterns encodable with the curre=
nt
number of bits, the number of bits per LZW code is increased by one.

The Raster Data stream that represents the actual output image can be
represented as:

         7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0
        +---------------+
        | LZW code size |

The conversion of the image from a series of pixel values to a transmitted =
or

1. Establish the Code Size - Define the number of bits needed to represent =

actual data.

2. Compress the Data - Compress the series of image pixels to a series of

3. Build a Series of Bytes - Take the set of compression codes and convert =
to a
string of 8-bit bytes.

4. Package the Bytes - Package sets of bytes into blocks preceded by charac=
ter
counts and output.

ESTABLISH CODE SIZE

The first byte of the Compressed Data stream is a value indicating the mini=
mum
number of bits required to represent the set of actual pixel values. Normal=
ly
this will be the same as the number of color bits. Because of some algorith=
mic
constraints however, black &amp; white images which have one color bit must=
 be
indicated as having a code size of 2.
This code size value also implies that the compression codes must start out=
 one
bit longer.

COMPRESSION

The LZW algorithm converts a series of data values into a series of codes w=
hich
may be raw values or a code designating a series of values. Using text
characters as an analogy, the output code consists of a character or a code
representing a string of characters.

The LZW algorithm used in GIF matches algorithmically with the standard LZW
algorithm with the following differences:

1.  A special Clear code is defined which resets all compression/decompress=
ion
parameters and tables to a start-up state. The value of this code is 2**&lt=
;code
size&gt;. For example if the code size indicated was 4 (image was 4 bits/pi=
xel)
the Clear code value would be 16 (10000 binary). The Clear code can appear =
at
any point in the image data stream and therefore requires the LZW algorithm=
 to
process succeeding codes as if a new data stream was starting. Encoders sho=
uld
output a Clear code as the first code of each image data stream.

2. An End of Information code is defined that explicitly indicates the end =
of
the image data stream. LZW processing terminates when this code is encounte=
red.
It must be the last code output by the encoder for an image. The value of t=
his
code is &lt;Clear code&gt;+1.

3. The first available compression code value is &lt;Clear code&gt;+2.

4. The output codes are of variable length, starting at &lt;code size&gt;+1=
 bits per
code, up to 12 bits per code. This defines a maximum code value of 4095
(0xFFF). Whenever the LZW code value would exceed the current code length, =
the
code length is increased by one. The packing/unpacking of these codes must =
then
be altered to reflect the new code length.

BUILD 8-BIT BYTES

Because the LZW compression used for GIF creates a series of variable lengt=
h
codes, of between 3 and 12 bits each, these codes must be reformed into a
series of 8-bit bytes that will be the characters actually stored or
transmitted. This provides additional compression of the image. The codes a=
re
formed into a stream of bits as if they were packed right to left and then







                                                                        32


picked off 8 bits at a time to be output.

Assuming a character array of 8 bits per character and using 5 bit codes to=
 be
packed, an example layout would be similar to:


     +---------------+
  0  |               |    bbbaaaaa
     +---------------+
  1  |               |    dcccccbb
     +---------------+
  2  |               |    eeeedddd
     +---------------+
  3  |               |    ggfffffe
     +---------------+
  4  |               |    hhhhhggg
     +---------------+
           . . .
     +---------------+
  N  |               |
     +---------------+


Note that the physical packing arrangement will change as the number of bit=
s
per compression code change but the concept remains the same.

PACKAGE THE BYTES

Once the bytes have been created, they are grouped into blocks for output b=
y
preceding each block of 0 to 255 bytes with a character count byte. A block
with a zero byte count terminates the Raster Data stream for a given image.
These blocks are what are actually output for the GIF image. This block for=
mat
has the side effect of allowing a decoding program the ability to read past=
 the
actual image data if necessary by reading block counts and then skipping ov=
er
the data.

Appendix
G. On-line Capabilities Dialogue.

NOTE : This section is currently (10 July 1990) under revision; the informa=
tion
provided here should be used as general guidelines. Code written based on t=
his
information should be designed in a flexible way to accommodate any changes
resulting from the revisions.

The following sequences are defined for use in mediating control between a =
GIF
sender and GIF receiver over an interactive communications line. These
sequences do not apply to applications that involve downloading of static G=
IF
files and are not considered part of a GIF file.

GIF CAPABILITIES ENQUIRY

The GIF Capabilities Enquiry sequence is issued from a host and requests an
interactive GIF decoder to return a response message that defines the graph=
ics
parameters for the decoder. This involves returning information about avail=
able
screen sizes, number of bits/color supported and the amount of color detail
supported. The escape sequence for the GIF Capabilities Enquiry is defined =
as:

ESC[&gt;0g           0x1B 0x5B 0x3E 0x30 0x67

GIF CAPABILITIES RESPONSE

The GIF Capabilities Response message is returned by an interactive GIF dec=
oder
and defines the decoder's display capabilities for all graphics modes that =
are
supported by the software. Note that this can also include graphics printer=
s as
well as a monitor screen. The general format of this message is:

#version;protocol{;dev, width, height, color-bits, color-res}...&lt;CR&gt;


'#'            GIF Capabilities Response identifier character.
version        GIF format version number;  initially '87a'.
protocol=3D'0'   No end-to-end protocol supported by decoder Transfer as di=
rect
               8-bit data stream.
protocol=3D'1'   Can use CIS B+ error correction protocol to transfer GIF d=
ata
               interactively from the host directly to the display.
dev =3D '0'      Screen parameter set follows.
dev =3D '1'      Printer parameter set follows.
width          Maximum supported display width in pixels.
height         Maximum supported display height in pixels.
color-bits     Number of bits per pixel supported. The number of supported
               colors is therefore 2**color-bits.
color-res      Number of bits per color component supported in the hardware
               color palette. If color-res is '0' then no hardware palette
               table is available.

Note that all values in the GIF Capabilities Response are returned as ASCII
decimal numbers and the message is terminated by a Carriage Return characte=
r.

The following GIF Capabilities Response message describes three standard IB=
M PC
Enhanced Graphics Adapter configurations with no printer; the GIF data stre=
am









                                                                        34


can be processed within an error correcting protocol:

#87a;1;0,320,200,4,0;0,640,200,2,2;0,640,350,4,2&lt;CR&gt;

ENTER GIF GRAPHICS MODE

Two sequences are currently defined to invoke an interactive GIF decoder in=
to
action. The only difference between them is that different output media are
selected. These sequences are:

ESC[&gt;1g     Display GIF image on screen

                  0x1B 0x5B 0x3E 0x31 0x67

ESC[&gt;2g   Display image directly to an attached graphics printer. The im=
age may
optionally be displayed on the screen as well.

                  0x1B 0x5B 0x3E 0x32 0x67

Note that the 'g' character terminating each sequence is in lowercase.

INTERACTIVE ENVIRONMENT

The assumed environment for the transmission of GIF image data from an
interactive application is a full 8-bit data stream from host to micro.  Al=
l
256 character codes must be transferrable. The establishing of an 8-bit dat=
a
path for communications will normally be taken care of by the host applicat=
ion
programs. It is however up to the receiving communications programs support=
ing
GIF to be able to receive and pass on all 256 8-bit codes to the GIF decode=
r
software.
